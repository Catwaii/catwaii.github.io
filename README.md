> [!WARNING]
> Work in progress. This is just a proof-of-concept test for the moment.

This repository hosts the source code for the Ascent Studio's official website.

It has yet to be fully setup. Currently missing [Commitizen](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/#making-your-repo-commitizen-friendly), some [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) hooks, metadata in `package.json` and a proper `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

The website currently serves files from a Github Action workflow, as described in [Deploying a Static Site](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy)

Built with [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) + [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) + [React Router](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router) + [TailwindCSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)

More information about setting up for development coming soon. Although it shouldn't be different from `git clone` and run `npm install`.
